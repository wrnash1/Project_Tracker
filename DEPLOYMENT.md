---

## Troubleshooting

### Application Won't Start

**Problem:** `ModuleNotFoundError`
```bash
# Solution: Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Problem:** `Permission denied` on run.sh
```bash
# Solution: Make executable
chmod +x run.sh
```

### Login Issues

**Problem:** Can't log in with default credentials
- Verify username (case-sensitive): `admin` or `pmuser`
- Verify password (case-sensitive): `admin123` or `pm123`
- Check if databases initialized (data/ folder should exist)

**Problem:** "Access Denied" on certain pages
- This is normal - pages are role-restricted
- Check your role in Admin Panel > User Management
- Contact administrator for role change if needed

### Sync Issues

**Problem:** Nothing to sync
- Create or edit a project first
- Make sure changes are saved locally
- Check "My Dashboard" for pending items

**Problem:** Sync failed
- Check error message for details
- Verify data/sync_inbox/ folder exists
- Try again in a few minutes

### Import Issues

**Problem:** Validation errors
- Download the template file first
- Verify all required columns present
- Check status values are valid
- Ensure PM IDs exist in system
- Look for duplicate CCR/NFIDs

### Performance Issues

**Problem:** Slow page loading
- Clear browser cache
- Restart application
- Check database file sizes in Admin Panel

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

**Daily (Administrators):**
- Process sync inbox
- Monitor Team Dashboard
- Check for errors in logs

**Weekly (Administrators):**
- Review user activity
- Check system configuration
- Verify backup strategy

**Monthly (Administrators):**

```bash
# Backup all databases
cp -r data/ backup/data_$(date +%Y%m%d)/

# Backup sync inbox
cp -r data/sync_inbox/ backup/sync_inbox_$(date +%Y%m%d)/
```

**Future Enhancement:**
- Automated backup scheduling
- Cloud backup integration
- Point-in-time recovery
